# Content
Mod adds a few new arrows, including:
- **Beginner arrow** - weaker and easy crafted version of default arrow
- **Crimson arrow** - When hit by an entity, applies the **rage** effect
- **Warped arrow** - When hit by an entity, applies the **confusion** effect
- **Glowing arrow** - lights up after hitting a block. Can be used as an accessible light source in caves
- **Messenger arrow** - can store one item like a bundle, doesn't despawns
- **Prismarine arrow** - doesn't slow down in water
- **Tnt arrow** - explodes on collision
- **Terracotta arrow** - shatters into ceramic shards after hitting the entity. Very fragile
- **"Sight"** - When hit by an entity, it does not allow it to despawn. If an arrow hits a player, it applies the **all-seeing** effect to him
  
- **"Oblivion"** - When hit by an entity, it permanently erases entity's AI. If an arrow hits a player, it permanently applies the **confusion** effect to them

**All these arrows, like the default one, are created in the fletching table**

A few effects:
- **Rage** - If the effect is applied to a mob, then it begins to attack everyone indiscriminately. When applied to a player, they become rabid
  
- **Confusion** - If the effect is applied to a mob, it stops attacking (almost) anyone. When applied to a player, they will no longer be able to switch slots and open screens like inventory or chest
  
- **All-seeing** - When applied to the player, they begin to see invisible entities

And enchanted feather with whistle mechanic.\
After the player hits an entity, they can **whistle** to glow up entity, or damage it (depends on feather)
